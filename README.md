# Supply-Chain-Optimization
Project for optimizing the supply chain of a goods distributor

This is a project I did for my course in Linear Optimization.
We used a case study of a goods distributor which sources goods from one country and distributed it to several cities in their own country.
Utilzing the principles of linear optimization like parameter definition, constraint identification, objective function assignment, we used a CPLEX model to find the optimum routes for transportation keeping cost and time of delivery in focus.
